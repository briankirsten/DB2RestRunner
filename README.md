#**DB2RestRunner**

Do you have a ton of little scripts hanging around that do something like this?

* Grab data from a database
* Use that data against a REST api to do something

Now you've got a nice little python script to handle this case for you.

Requires - Python (tested on 2.7) and MySQLdb
